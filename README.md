## Key points
1. To display data we need to use `println()`.
2. VAR vs VAL concept

## Main.kt
1. Entry point
2. Should always be named as `main()`

## Variables

Syntax
```dtd
var/val name: TYPE = VALUE
var x: Int =3;
val x: Int =3;
var name: string = "Chaitanya";
TYPE can be Int, string etc
```
We do not need to explicitly specify the type

VAR vs VAL
1. VAL is similar to const and is immutable
2. VAR is mutable
